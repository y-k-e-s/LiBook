# LiBook

Simple library system writen in pure Java(no Spring, no Hibernate), integrated with MySql data base -> writen long time ago, at the begining of my work with Java, from stylistic point of view code for sure is a mess

For normal users(clients) functionality includes: browsing through books, searching, sorting, borrowing, and giving back books. 

For Admin functionality includes: all of above plus: 
adding and deleting new books, confirming clients give back requests, acces to details of all borrowed books(like "borrow by", "borrow to" etc)
